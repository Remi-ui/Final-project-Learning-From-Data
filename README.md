<h2>Installation of dependencies</h2>

<h2>How to train the model</h2>

<h2>How to preprocess the data so it is in the correct format</h2>  

<h2>How to train the models on the data</h2>

<h2>How to use one of your already trained models to predict on unseen data</h2>

<h2>How to evaluate an output file using the gold standard</h2>

Run output_evaluate.py and specify the path to the desired prediction_vs_gold file. If (for example) the desired file is located in experiments/naive_bayes, run the following command:
```
python3 output_evaluate.py --path experiments/naive_bayes/prediction_vs_gold.txt
```
